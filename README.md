# Handwritten-Digit-Classification

This project introduces the basics of deep learning using a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, build a model, train it, and evaluate its performance.

# Project Objective
To build a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy.

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, with 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples.
Each image is labeled with the digit it represents (0 to 9).
Source: The dataset can be directly loaded from TensorFlow or Keras.

# Features
- Preprocessing of the MNIST dataset.
- Building and training a simple neural network.
- Achieving high accuracy on test data.
- Making predictions on new handwritten digit samples

# Requirements
 - Python 3.x
 - TensorFlow
 - NumPy
 - Matplotlib
